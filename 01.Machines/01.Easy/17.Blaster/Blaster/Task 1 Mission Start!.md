Throughout this room, we'll be looking at alternative modes of exploitation without the use of Metasploit or really exploitation tools in general beyond nmap and dirbuster.

_This room is a remix of my previous room [Retro](https://tryhackme.com/room/retro) with some complications I added to that room having been removed. For increased difficulty and an exercise in patience, check that room out after this. In addition, this room is the sequel to [Ice](https://tryhackme.com/room/ice). - DarkStar7471_
