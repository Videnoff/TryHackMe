We will be installing Nessus on a Local Kali VM.

**Warning**: Do **not** install Nessus on the **THM AttackBox**. It will **not** work, as there's no sufficient space!

Other OS's **will not** be covered in this walkthrough, in which case the official installation guide can be found below.

We will then download the Nessus-#.##.#-debian6_**amd64.**deb file

Save it to your **/Downloads/** folder

Step #3  

In the terminal we will navigate to that folder and run the following command:  

sudo dpkg -i **package_file.deb**

Remember to replace package_file.deb with the file name you downloaded.

This will take some time, which will depend on your internet connection and the hardware attached to your VM.

If the progress bar appears to be **not moving**, it means you do not have **enough space** on the VM to install.  

**Step #9**  

**Log in** with the account credentials you made earlier.
