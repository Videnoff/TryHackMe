Nessus vulnerability scanner is exactly what you think is its! A vulnerability scanner!

It uses techniques similar to Nmap to find and report vulnerabilities, which are then, presented in a nice GUI for us to look at.

Nessus is different from other scanners as it doesn't make assumptions when scanning,

like assuming the web application is running on port 80 for instance.

  

Nessus offers a free and paid service, in which some features are left out from the free to make you more inclined to buy the paid service. 

Their pricing is similar to Burp Suite, so unless you got some spare change, we will be just be using their free version.
