The admin page seems to give us a login form. In situations like this it is always worth it to check for "low-hanging fruit". In the case of login forms one of the first things to check for is SQL Injection.

Recommended Tool: sqlmap  

Useful Flags:

| -u      | Specifies which url to attack                                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --forms | Automatically selects parameters from <form> elements on the page |
| --dump  | Used to retrieve data from the db once SQLI is found              |
| -a      | Grabs just about everything from the db                           |
