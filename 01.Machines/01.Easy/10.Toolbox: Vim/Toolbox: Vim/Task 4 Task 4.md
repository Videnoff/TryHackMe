Before we get going...

**You're doing really well! Keep it up! With practice you'll be an extremely competent Vim user!**

One of the most common usages for a text editor is to copy, cut and paste things in and out of the editor- knowing how to do this is essential to being able to collate and use text in Vim. 

These questions will focus on three commands:

- cut
- copy
- paste

Tackle these questions, and remember- once you've completed them keep practising! 

Guide

I suggest making a small learning directory, and writing a few small documents, in Vim of course, to test these out on- if you get stuck, there's the help guide outlined in the last task- or you can use google.
