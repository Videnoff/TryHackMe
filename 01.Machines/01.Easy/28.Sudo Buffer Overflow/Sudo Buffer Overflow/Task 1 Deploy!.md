To deploy this virtual machine you must be connected to the TryHackMe network using your OpenVPN configuration file. If you don't know how to do this, take a quick look at the [OpenVPN room](https://tryhackme.com/room/openvpn) first.

Once you're connected click the green "Deploy" button to start an instance of the machine, then we can get started!

(_Please note that VMs can take a few minutes to boot up fully)_

You will be using SSH to log into the machine. On Linux this is done from the terminal, with a command that looks like this:

```
ssh -p <port-number> <username>@<remote-machine-ip>
```

On Windows you would usually use a piece of software such as [PuTTY](https://putty.org/). You would then login like this:

Whichever method you're using, you will then be asked for a password, which, once entered, will let you execute commands remotely on the machine. Credentials will be provided later in the room.
