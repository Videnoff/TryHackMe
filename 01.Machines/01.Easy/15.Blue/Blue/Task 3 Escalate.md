| If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected)                                                                                                            | post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter | ![[Pasted image 20240311201931.png]]                                         |
| Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | SESSION                                | ![[Pasted image 20240311195626.png]]                                         |
| Set the required option, you may need to list all of the sessions to find your target here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No answer needed                       | ![[Pasted image 20240311200100.png]]                                         |
| Run! If this doesn't work, try completing the exploit from the previous task once more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | No answer needed                       | ![[Pasted image 20240311200104.png]]                                         |
| Once the meterpreter shell conversion completes, select that session for use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | No answer needed                       | ![[Pasted image 20240311200632.png]]                                         |
| Verify that we have escalated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Run getsystem to confirm this. Feel free to open a dos shell via the command 'shell' and run 'whoami'. This should return that we are indeed system. Background this shell afterwards and select our meterpreter session for usage again.                                                                               | No answer needed                       | ![[Pasted image 20240311200907.png]]                                         |
| List all of the processes running via the 'ps' command. Just because we are system doesn't mean our process is. Find a process towards the bottom of this list that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and write down the process id (far left column).                                                                                                                        | No answer needed                       | ![[Pasted image 20240311201102.png]]<br>![[Pasted image 20240311201552.png]] |
| Migrate to this process using the 'migrate PROCESS_ID' command where the process id is the one you just wrote down in the previous step. This may take several attempts, migrating processes is not very stable. If this fails, you may need to re-run the conversion process or reboot the machine and start once again. If this happens, try a different process next time. | No answer needed                       | ![[Pasted image 20240311201818.png]]                                         |
