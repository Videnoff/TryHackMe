Well done.

Regular expressions are very powerful, even at their most basic usage. There are many resources to study and practise online as well, which I strongly recommend.

Also, if you're planning on using regex to develop something and you want to search for something like an e-mail, you should search for premade expressions instead of writing your own.

With regex, you have to think specific, but not **too** specific, because then you might come up with complicated solutions when there are other more elegant and simple ones.
