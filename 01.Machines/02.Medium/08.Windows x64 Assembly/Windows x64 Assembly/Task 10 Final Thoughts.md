That wraps up our introductory look at reverse engineering. You should now know a little more about low-level operations, what registers are, how assembly works, and how memory is organized. Hopefully, you enjoyed this room, however, this was one of the more boring parts of this subject so don't fret. Getting to reverse engineer and analyze real software is where lots of fun is to be had, which is what you will learn in future rooms of this series!  
  
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own software and reverse it to see what it looks like. I often do this when I want to learn or get familiar with a new topic. It's especially useful when learning new methods of attack or trying exploits. It also makes you a better programmer which is nice for exploit development and more advanced reverse engineering techniques.  
  
For further reading, the [Intel](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html) and [AMD](https://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/)Â ("AMD64 Architecture" section) manuals are great places to look when it comes to assembly. They contain loads of information directly from the people who made your CPU. [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/) (aka MSDN) is still the go-to place for developers and the documented low-level Windows concepts. Also, check out [Awesome Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/ReversingID/Awesome-Reversing) on GitHub.  
  
Anyways, I hope to see you in the next room of this series!
