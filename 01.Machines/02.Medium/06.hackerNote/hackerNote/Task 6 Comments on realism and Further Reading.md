**Web app**

This room was designed to be more realistic and less CTF focused. The logic behind the timing attack is mentioned in OWASP's authentication section, and a fairly similar timing attack existed on OpenSSH, allowing username enumeration. I've included links to this in the Further Reading section

Password hints in webapps are normally considered bad practice, but large companies still often include them. Adobe suffered a large databreach affecting users of Creative Cloud and decryption of the passwords was made much easier due to the password hints also included in the breach.  
  

**Privilege** **Escalation**

The privilege escalation for this box is a real world CVE vulnerability, and affected the default configurations of sudo on macOS, Linux Mint and ElementaryOS.
