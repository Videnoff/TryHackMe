You have learned how ARP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP can detect live hosts by completing this room. Any response from a host is an indication that it is online. Below is a quick summary of the command-line options for Nmap that we have covered.

|Scan Type|Example Command|
|---|---|
|ARP Scan|`sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|ICMP Echo Scan|`sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|ICMP Timestamp Scan|`sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|ICMP Address Mask Scan|`sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|TCP SYN Ping Scan|`sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30`|
|TCP ACK Ping Scan|`sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30`|
|UDP Ping Scan|`sudo nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30`|

Remember to add `-sn` if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning. Omitting `-sn` will let Nmap default to port-scanning the live hosts.

|Option|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`-n`|no DNS lookup|
|`-R`|reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts|
|`-sn`|host discovery only|
