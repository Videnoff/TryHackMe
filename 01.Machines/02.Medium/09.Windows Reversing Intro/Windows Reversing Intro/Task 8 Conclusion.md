That's the basic hands-on introduction to reverse engineering Windows, hope you enjoyed it! Hopefully, you are somewhat more comfortable with reverse engineering software now that you have seen it and had the opportunity to be hands-on. Next room we will finally get into some real reverse engineering taking a look at a set of functions exported by NTDLL. It's going to be quite a step up but I think it'll be a great way to learn. For those who are interested, we will then use our knowledge to write code that uses the functions. Trust me when I say reverse engineering can be a bit of a drag to learn, but it's much more fun once you finally know what you are doing and can start researching on your own.

Here are some places you can learn more about IDA:

If you have the time I'd recommend looking into Ghidra and, if you plan on sticking with Windows, x64dbg. Ghidra is a great alternative to IDA, just not as mature. The nicest thing about Ghidra over IDA is the price. Ghidra is free, IDA is expensive. So far we've been using IDA Freeware which is great but there are some serious limitations. With a price tag of free, Ghidra supports loads of architectures and is written in Java so it runs on pretty much anything. Its decompiler is pretty good, I do think the decompiler IDA has is better though.

See you in the next room!
