Within this room, we will look at [OWASP's TOP 10 vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) in web applications. You will find these in all types of web applications. But for today we will be looking at OWASP's own creation, Juice Shop!

_The **FREE** Burpsuite rooms '[Burpsuite Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuitebasics)'  and '[Burpsuite Repeater](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater)'  are recommended before completing this room!

Juice Shop is a large application so we will not be covering every topic from the top 10.  

We will, however, cover the following topics which we recommend you take a look at as you progress through this room.

<------------------------------------------------->

[Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)

[Broken Authentication](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication)

[Sensitive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)

[Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control)

**PLEASE NOTE!**  

**[Task 3] and onwards will require a flag, which will be displayed on completion of the task.**

**Troubleshooting**

The web app takes about 2-5 minutes to load, so please be patient!  

Temporarily disable burp in your proxy settings for the current browser. Refresh the page and the flag will be shown. 

_(This is not an issue with the application but an issue with burp stopping the flag from being shown._ )  

If you are doing the XSS Tasks and they are not working. Clear your cookies and site data, as this can sometimes be an issue. 

If you are sure that you have completed the task but it's still not working. Go to **[Task 8]**, as this will allow you to check its completion.

Answer the questions below

Deploy the VM attached to this task to get started! You can access this machine by using your [browser-based machine](https://tryhackme.com/room/kali), or if you're connected through [OpenVPN](https://tryhackme.com/access).

Once the machine has loaded, access it by copying and pasting its IP into your browser; if you're using the browser-based machine, paste the machines IP into a browser on that machine.
