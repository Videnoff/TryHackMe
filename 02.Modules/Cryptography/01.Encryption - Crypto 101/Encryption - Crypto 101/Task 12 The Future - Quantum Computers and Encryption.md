Quantum computers will soon be a problem for many types of encryption.

### Asymmetric and Quantum

While it’s unlikely we’ll have sufficiently powerful quantum computers until around 2030, once these exist encryption that uses RSA or Elliptical Curve Cryptography will be very fast to break. This is because quantum computers can very efficiently solve the mathematical problems that these algorithms rely on for their strength.

### AES/DES and Quantum

AES with 128 bit keys is also likely to be broken by quantum computers in the near future, but 256 bit AES can’t be broken as easily. Triple DES is also vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers.

### Current Recommendations

The NSA recommends using RSA-3072 or better for asymmetric encryption and AES-256 or better for symmetric encryption. There are several competitions currently running for quantum safe cryptographic algorithms, and it’s likely that we will have a new encryption standard before quantum computers become a threat to RSA and AES.

### Learn More about Quantum Computers and Cryptography

If you’d like to learn more about this, NIST has resources that detail what the issues with current encryption is and the currently proposed solutions for these. [https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8105](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8105)

I also recommend the book "Cryptography Apocalypse" By Roger A. Grimes, as this was my introduction to quantum computing and quantum safe cryptography.
