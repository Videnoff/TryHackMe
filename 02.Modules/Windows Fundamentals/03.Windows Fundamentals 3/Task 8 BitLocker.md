What is **BitLocker**?

Per Microsoft, "_BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers_".

On devices with TPM installed, BitLocker offers the best protection.

Per Microsoft, "_BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline_".

Refer to the official Microsoft documentation to learn more about BitLocker [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview). 

**Note**: The BitLocker feature is not included in the attached VM.
