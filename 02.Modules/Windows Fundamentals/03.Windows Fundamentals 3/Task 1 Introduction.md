We will continue our journey exploring the Windows operating system.  

To summarize the previous two rooms:

- In [Windows Fundamentals 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx), we covered the desktop, the file system, user account control, the control panel, settings, and the task manager.   
    
- In [Windows Fundamentals 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals2x0x), we covered various utilities, such as System Configuration, Computer Management, Resource Monitor, etc.
